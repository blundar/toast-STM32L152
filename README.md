Code for STM32LDISCOVERY + ChibiOS based reflow oven controller

This is horrible, horrible, horrible code.  This was done as an attempt to learn ChibiOS as much as to do anything useful.  Please check and double check before using.  I'm pretty sure the directory ARMCM3-STM32L152-TOAST has the most recent copy in use and the TOAST2 directories are unfinished development versions.
